We still might have not been able to build the Ironman suit, but we can assure you that after seeing our projects you would be struggling to keep that jaw of yours above the ground. From Humanoids to Robotic Arms, Autonomous indoor navigation to swarm of tiny robots we build stuff that can make you the coolest among your fellow mates. Believe us when we say that none of us had any idea of Robotics when we came here, neither do we expect anything from you. All you have to do now is to come up for the Robotics Club Orientation and we will take you places from there.");
